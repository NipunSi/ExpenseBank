### ExpenseBank

Every few seconds, the app fetches a batch of expense data from a built in API. The JSON data is decoded and displayed on the screen in a simple, clean table view. The category with the most spend is displayed as well as the total amount spend and whether it is over or under the month's budget.

### What I learned

I was able to learn a lot more about building UI programatically and how it compares to using storyboards, which is what i've always used in the past. I also got the chance to understand a small amout of Combine and learn how it could be used with networking. In addition, I gained even more experience making custom UITableViewCell's and was able to fill them in within the cell class to reduce code in the view controller.

## Concepts used

* VC, Models, and Interactor for architecture
* Fully programatic UI and constraints
* Working with Combine and JSON data
* Fully custom table view cell
